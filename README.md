# Iâ€™m using github under protest

GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce
Software (FOSS).  I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop my FOSS project. I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
